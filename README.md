Smart refrigerator management system
**
Abstract:-
        The aim of this project is to design a low-cost smart refrigerator management system built using Raspberry Pi. We maintain the list of contents of the fridge and the date of purchase. Users can view them using a mobile application to know what is in the fridge and monitor them. This system can assist a family in restocking vegetables, to reduce food waste, and help them make purchase and cooking decisions up to an extent.
1.  Introduction

What is IOT:-
Internet of Things is the concept of connecting any device to the Internet and to other connected devices. The IoT is a giant network of connected things and people – all of which collect and share data about the way they are used and about the environment around them.

How it works:-
        	Devices and objects with built in sensors are connected to an Internet of Things platform, which integrates data from the different devices and applies analytics to share the most valuable information with applications built to address specific needs.


These powerful IoT platforms can pinpoint exactly what information is useful and what can safely be ignored. This information can be used to detect patterns, make recommendations, and detect possible problems before they occur.
 

2.  Overview
Applications:-
Tackling the food wastage problem:-
		The fridge of the future might soon be able to monitor its own contents, and alert you before your food becomes a science experiment. By maintaining a list of contents of the fridge and the date at which they are bought, we can plan efficiently and reduce food waste.

Manage Shopping:-
What if your fridge could monitor its own contents, and ping you while you’re at the store to remind you that you still have it and don’t need to buy more? If we can maintain the contents and quantities of each item, we can notify the user during shopping.

Figure out Recipes:-
What if it could let you know that your green beans were at peak freshness, and suggest a recipe for you to cook them?  The list of items can also make the process of cooking easier. 

Input from user:-
We receive input to Pi through a camera i.e, using OpenCV. Users can insert or delete or view the list at any time. Users can also perform multiple inserts at a time.
Mail:-
Notification through mail allows users to keep track of your food purchases and sort them by expiration date. Since users can view the notification through any device like a smartphone, it also enhances user experience.


	Extensions:- 
	    We can extend this project by adding features like :- 
(1)  Capturing and detecting the contents using camera.
(2)  Gathering information about quality of food items available.
(3)  Prepare list of groceries for shopping.
(4)  Suggest recipes based on the YouTube subscriptions.

3.   Conclusion
As we are moving towards smart living, our concept of developing affordable yet smart fridge management systems makes it easier to reduce food wastage, helps in grocery shopping and also in cooking suggestions.

my smart fridge connected to a smart home assistant like Alexa or Constellation Connect is ready to answer your commands. we can adjust temperature, check inventory, order food and drinks and create and send a shopping list. we can even ask what recipes will work with the items you have on hand if you are stumped on what to make for dinner. Some models have multimedia features so that they can play music or video on the screen on the front of the unit.
